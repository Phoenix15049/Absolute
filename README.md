## **About the Project**
![Absolute](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenix15049/Absolute/master/Assets/CubeTestGIF.gif)

Absolute Engine is a **small 3D graphics engine** aimed at developers looking for a balance between performance and ease of use. Built using OpenGL and written in C++ and C, this engine offers essential functionality for 3D rendering without overwhelming users with complex systems.

### Key Objectives:
- **Moderate Complexity**: Suitable for both beginner and intermediate developers looking to learn or build on an existing framework.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to modify and extend core features to suit their project needs.
