## **About the Project**

Absolute Engine is a **small 3D graphics engine** aimed at developers looking for a balance between performance and ease of use. Built using OpenGL and written in C++ and C, this engine offers essential functionality for 3D rendering without overwhelming users with complex systems.

### Key Objectives:
- **Moderate Complexity**: Suitable for both beginner and intermediate developers looking to learn or build on an existing framework.
- **Cross-platform**: Works on major operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
- **Customizable**: Allows developers to modify and extend core features to suit their project needs.

## **Features**
- Real-time rendering with OpenGL
- Basic and advanced lighting models (Phong, Blinn-Phong)
- Scene management system (i said inshallah)
- Support for standard 3D model formats (OBJ for now,later maybe FBX)
- Basic post-processing effects (Bloom, HDR)
- Cross-platform windowing and input management
- Simple integration with physics engines ()
